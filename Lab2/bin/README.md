## IMPORTANT INFORMATION

You need the 4 binary files in Lab 2:
- *conv_input.bin* - Input 736 x 1280 (HD) RGB image
- *conv_weights.bin* - Convolution layer weights
- *conv_bias.bin* - Convolution layer bias
- *conv_output.bin* - Convolution layer output with 64 channels, each of dimension 368 x 640

As GitHub does not allow uploading files larger than 25MB, please download the binary files for this lab [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/a1mn72ulpqtbu56xfclhs/AAHy2aatAua-qTWC11Eu7Gg?rlkey=dyjqa3xz8jxhjidynk02cwtme&st=7wvzx6il&dl=0) and maintain the same directory structure.

You can also copy the same data files that have already been downloaded on the server by using the following command:
```bash
cp /data-hdd/MICS-6001C-Labs/bin/conv_bin.zip ./
unzip conv_bin.zip
```
