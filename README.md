# MICS 6001C - Custom Computing with FPGAs

This repository contains lab materials for the MICS 6001C Custom Computing with FPGAs at HKUST(GZ).

For Assignment 1, you need to complete the task of **Optimize the performance of the vector-matrix multiplication (GEMV) unit** in the `Lab1` folder on the `main` branch.

For Assignment 2, you need to complete the task of **Integrate the optimized GEMV unit into the Tiny-Llama, implementing hardware reuse for the QKVO and FFN linear projection layers**, referencing the `llama2-7B-baseline` branch.

In addition, for the group project, you need to modify the code on the `llama2-7B-baseline` branch to implement your functionality.
